# Delivery management 


### The problem


- #### Backstory:
    Lately due the virus there has been a giant increase in deliveries, and apparentley a lot of restraunts still deal with the headache of having to call the delivery guy/gal to come to their restraunt and pick up the the delivery so it can be delivered to the clients.
    
    That's not ideal, cause a good portion of delivery guys/gals are bit problematic, they either don't show up on time, or sometimes don't pickup the phone etc..
    
    Now there are a bunch of startups or companies that already do similar stuff to this, Wolt being a gaint one in Tel aviv (they install an Ipad in the restraunt, they give the delivery a fancy bag to hold the food and more rewards annnnd they also pay him for delivering, with this system they manage to deliver in under 30 minutes). 
    but Haifa for example doesn't have this, now i'm not saying we should build something similar to Wolt we are going to start small.
    

- Restraunts and the people that deliver the food don't have an actual commitment or bond between them. and there is a time wasted on contacting or going after the delivery guys/gals.

### The _suggested_ solution

An app that connects the restraunts and delivery guy/gal together more than usual, the app is is split between 2 users:
1) Restaurant
    - as a restraunt owner/worker i would like to go into the app and clarify that I have something that needs to be delivered.
    - from there my delivery would be assigned to a delivery guy/gal.
    - I would get notified that the delivery guy/gal has taken the order and on his way.
    - as a restraunt owner/worker I would like to be able to track the delivery guy/gal, so I know his progress.
    - if the payment choice is cash. after the item was delivered to the client, and the delivery guy/gal came back and me handed the money i'd like to receive a confirmation box checking if I actually have received the money (so the delivery guys don't bambozel us).


2) Delivery guy/gal

    - as a delivery guy/gal I would like to be notified of delivery offers from restraunts if there is any.
    - when the delivery is done, click a button to notify the business owner.

> the current users of this type that we have are part of a company, and will be asked to download our app.

# Technical developer notes

So this is an interesting project technically, cause we need to be able to track the delivery people on a map, we might need firebase ? (so we can see coordinates changing realy fast and live).
what are other challenges we might have ?

- we decided to shift to React Ionic since there would be less of a learning curve
